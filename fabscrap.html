			<p>This project is to design a website for Jessica Schreiber and FABSCRAP, her non-profit organization that works with fashion brands, designers, and garment industry companies in New York City by providing convenient pickup and recycling of their textile waste. Businesses with textile waste typically have volumes of fabric that are too large for donation, but too small for industrial recycling, and no good way to store or transport it. FabScrap seeks to fill this current market gap by providing a service to pick-up, store, and process fabric scraps from these businesses, and either direct the material for industrial recycling, or creative “upcycling” with artisans and small-scale designers. Ultimately, FabScrap aims to become a valuable resource for businesses on both sides of the fabric recycling equation.</p>

			<p>The web design process started with a questionnaire and subsequent interview in order to understand the service and gather requirements. This was followed by the creation of a site map, wireframes, and style boards. </p>

		<p>In order to attract clients, FabScrap aims to show that recycling is good for their brand. The website should convey that FabScrap is an expert on the issue of fashion and sustainability, well-researched, highly knowledgeable, trustworthy, and thus a valuable partner for any fashion-related company. To this end the website should look fresh and employ current web design trends, while at the same time not visually compete or clash with the branding of potential clients, so that the companies may easily imagine that FabScrap can support their own brand identities.</p>
