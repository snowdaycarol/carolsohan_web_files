			<p>This class project was to design a website for Marilia Marien, a clinical psychologist and MBSR-qualified teacher who is also active in a mindfulness meditation community and has a personal meditation practice. The goal of the website is to attract customers to her Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course, by explaining the benefits of the class, fees, schedule, and emotional commitment, as well as Marilia’s credentials to teach the class. Ideally visitors will pay for the class through the website. For paid class participants, the website will give access to the audio recordings, forms and class handouts. The website will offer more general resources for site visitors who just want to know more about mindfulness and meditation.</p>

			<p>The website needs to reflect Marilia’s approach and personality, which is warm, calm, accepting, and professional, as well as intelligent and based in science and research. Visitors should feel that the website has helped them personally and offers them hopefulness.</p>
