			<p>This project was to re-design the homepage of an existing website for a tattoo studio in Hawaii. The website and a starting wireframe were assigned by the instructor. The original website contained a lot of descriptive text conveying the business’s personality and about their studio practices and policies, however, it was poorly organized and laid out. The original site also looked amateur and outdated, and its red and black palette did not support their self-description as friendly, inviting, and highly professional.</p>

		<div class="project-item">
			<p>The design process included a site analysis, the creation of a mood-board and two versions of a high-fidelity mockup. The first pass attempted to improve the site's navigation while also connoting a friendly, beachy place of business. Feedback from the first mockup suggested that the design should more strongly present tattoos as a form of art and that the website should act as an art gallery for the studio.</p>

		<div class="project-item">
		<p>The final homepage featured images of tattoos, more artistic typography, and pulled in an inkier palette but also incorporated warm color accents. The "Gridism” framework was used to create a responsive design. Additional tools were used such as “Font Awesome” and a little Javascript to create a smoother page load.</p>

			<h4>About me</h4>
			<p>I used to make hand-thrown, functional pottery with a goal towards making practical objects that were also a joy to use. Now I strive to make useful and straightforward web sites that are also a joy to use.</p>
